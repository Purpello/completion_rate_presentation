# Analysis of Six-Year graduation rates for 41 selected universities

This was a an analysis that I initiated and completed while preparing for a job interview as a data analyst at a university.  
I undertook it to showcase various skills including:

-Creating an [html report] (https://purpello.github.io/completion_rate_presentation/presentation/) that mixes text and interactive graphics
-Doing a complex data analysis of a large data set, including linear regression
-Running Python in RStudio code and utilizing [Quarto] (https://quarto.org/) to create the report

This repository also includes the raw data used in the analysis and the RStudio/Quarto code (the .qmd file).
