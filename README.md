# Analysis of Six-Year graduation rates for 41 selected universities

This was a an analysis that I initiated and completed while preparing for a job interview as a data analyst at a university.  I undertook it to showcase various skills including:

-Creating an [html report](https://purpello.github.io/completion_rate_presentation/presentation/) that mixes text and interactive graphics

-Doing a complex data analysis of a large data set, including linear regression

-Running Python in RStudio code and utilizing [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to create the report

This repository also includes the data dictionary for the raw data, which can be downloaded via a link in the report.  The code for creating the report in RStudio/Quarto is the .qmd file.
