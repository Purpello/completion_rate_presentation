<section id="rationale-and-purpose" class="level1">
<h1>Rationale and Purpose</h1>
<p>Six-year completion rate <strong>(SYCR)</strong> is the proportion of students enrolled in an institution who sought and achieved a degree within 6 years (150% of normal time for a four-year institution) and is a common <a href="https://www.evisions.com/resources/blog/5-commonly-found-metrics-student-success/">measure of university student success</a>. If one university is to be compared to other similar universities on SYCR, it is important to understand the most important factors that cause universities to differ on this measure. Furthermore, universities nationwide recognize that there are <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/search?query=&amp;query2=&amp;resultType=table&amp;page=1&amp;sortBy=date_desc&amp;surveyComponents=Admissions%20(ADM)&amp;surveyComponents=Graduation%20Rates%20(GR)&amp;surveyComponents=Graduation%20Rates%20200%%20(GR200)&amp;surveyComponents=Outcome%20Measures%20(OM)&amp;surveyComponents=Student%20Financial%20Aid%20(SFA)&amp;collectionYears=2020-21&amp;sources=Tables%20Library&amp;overlayTableId=32472">ethnic disparities in graduation rates</a> and that those gaps should be closed. So, understanding how SYCR drivers differ by ethnicity is important.</p>
<p>This is an <strong>exploratory investigation</strong> in order to understand the factors that predict differences in SYCR among the selected universities and how those might differ for White, Black and Hispanic students. The purpose is to present early results for feedback and <strong>get a decision on how or if to proceed.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="college-scorecard-data" class="level1">
<h1>College Scorecard Data</h1>
<p>College Scorecard data was used to investigate the factors that drive six-year completion rate (SYCR). This data covers a wide range of institution types from small two-year, commuter, associate degree institutions to large four-year, bachelor degree institutions that are also doctoral universities with very high research activity. Some characteristics of the data include:</p>
<ul>
<li>6,543 institutions</li>
<li>3,214 variables</li>
<li><a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/">Publicly available</a> from the US Department of Education for the academic year 2021-2022</li>
<li>Well documented via an extensive data dictionary</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="criteria-for-selecting-the-41-universities" class="level1">
<h1>Criteria for selecting the 41 universities</h1>
<p>The University of Colorado, Boulder (CU Boulder) was chosen as the focus of this investigation. In order to compare CU Boulder to similar institutions, the data were explored to find criteria that <strong>resemble CU Boulder</strong>. The 41 universities were selected from 6,543 institutions based on these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher Learning Commission is the accreditor for the institution</li>
<li>Publicly controlled</li>
<li>Main campus</li>
<li>Admission rate &gt; 0.15 (screens out some military academies)</li>
<li>More than 10,000 undergraduates</li>
<li>Four-year, full-time programs</li>
<li>Doctoral universities with high or very high research activities</li>
<li>Primarily grant bachelor’s degrees</li>
</ul>

<h1>Six-year Completion Rates for 41 Institutions</h1>
<p>Figure 1 shows six-year completion rate (SYCR) for the 41 schools analyzed, sorted by overall SYCR. You can hover over individual points to get the SYCR. In most cases, the Hispanic SYCR falls between those for Black and White students. The University of Oklahoma, Norman (12th from the top) is an exception, where the SYCR for Hispanic students slightly exceeds that for White students. Our target school, CU Boulder, is 13th from the top.</p>
<p>The horizontal spread of points for any given school is a measure of the gap between the highest and lowest SYCR. The first three schools in the top five (Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio State) have a fairly small spread whereas the next two (Illinois, Michigan State) have a higher spread.</p>

</table>
<p>Three of the predictors have a positive relationship with SYCR and three have a negative effect. Increases in average faculty salary, average total cost of tuition and out of state tuition and fees are all associated with an increase in SYCR. Increases in admission rate, percentage of students with Pell Grants and percentage of students over 25 years old are all associated with decreases in SYCR. The regression coefficients, also called beta weights, can be interpreted as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For every 1 standard deviation change in the predictor there is a 𝛽 standard deviation change in SYCR, holding other predictors constant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, for example, for every 1 standard deviation change in faculty salary there is a .17 standard deviation change in six-year completion rate for White students, .09 for Black students and .10 for Hispanic students.</p>
<p>The predictors can be thought of as falling into two groups: economic selection factors and ability to succeed factors. For all of the predictors, the warning that <em>correlation is not causality</em> should be remembered. For example, does paying faculty more directly lead to higher six-year completion rates? Or is higher average faculty salary correlated with one or more other factors that cause higher completion rates (like student self-selection)?</p>
<section id="economic-selection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economic-selection">Economic selection</h3>
<p>The first 3 predictors (faculty salary, total cost and out of state T&amp;F) and the Pell Grants predictor could all represent economic selection factors on students. The fact that higher cost of attendance and higher out of state tuition and fees lead to higher SYCR could indicate that the economic factors that make it possible for you to attend a more costly institution also favor your ability to complete a degree. Having a lower percentage of Pell Grant recipients is possibly an indicator of the same thing: that is, more of the student body has been selected by those advantageous economic factors. As discussed earlier, it is possible that higher average faculty salary represents a direct effect on SYCR. The fact that it is not a statistically significant factor for Black and Hispanic students could further indicate that the increased salaries are not going to the areas that affect those students. Higher faculty salaries could also be a result of institutions being more economically advantaged and therefore able to pay higher salaries to some faculty and at the same time, charge premium prices to their students, engaging the economic selection factors and their advantages described above.</p>
</section>
<section id="ability-to-succeed" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ability-to-succeed">Ability to succeed</h3>
<p>A higher admission rate and a higher percentage of students over 25 both predict lower SYCR. These could both represent selection of students who are potentially less able to succeed in a traditional university setting. For students over 25, <a href="https://hechingerreport.org/universities-that-are-recruiting-older-students-often-leave-them-floundering/">it is known</a> that they often struggle because the structure of the university education doesn’t match well with the demands of having a job, married life with children, and other factors. Having a higher admission rate may mean that students are being admitted that have less of an academic track record of success and may therefore be unequipped to succeed at university. A university seeking to serve the public better by increasing the diversity of students along these dimensions will have a lower SYCR.</p>
<p>Both the positive and negative predictors show us that you can’t just look at the SYCR for a university to judge its overall ability to matriculate students in six years. The contextual factors related to economic selection and ability to succeed are important to understand.</p>

<p>Six reference universities are also highlighted on the graph in addition to CU Boulder. The color codes for those are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot%20from%202023-08-21%2014-59-02.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>They are, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>University of Michigan, Ann-Arbor</li>
<li>University of Wisconsin, Madison</li>
<li>University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</li>
<li>University of Oklahoma, Norman</li>
<li>University of Colorado, Boulder</li>
<li>University of Missouri, Columbia</li>
<li>Colorado State University, Fort Collins</li>
</ul>
<p>If a point is above the regression line, it can be thought of as over-performing the regression equation - that is the actual value for SYCR is more than you would expect given the predictors. Conversely, if a point is below the line, it is under-performing the predictions.</p>
<p>Figure 2a above shows that our reference schools all fall pretty close to the line predicting SYCR for White students, except for CU Boulder and Missouri, which seem to be underperforming a bit. Completely diagnosing the underperformance is beyond the scope of this document, but an example of under-performance for CU Boulder is that its faculty salaries are similar to that of Michigan (mouse over to see), its out of state tuition and fees are like Wisconsin, and its total cost of attendance is like Michigan and Illinois, but it’s SYCR is much lower.</p>
<p>Figures 2b and 2c show that the University of Oklahoma, Norman is over-performing for Black and Hispanic SYCR rates and Colorado State university is over-performing in terms of Black SYCR. The point of this analysis is to provide reference points for schools that might be models to study to better understand how to improve these rates.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>Six predictors do a good job predicting six-year completion rates (SYCR) for 41 universities that are large research institutions. The six predictors could be grouped into economic selection factors and ability to succeed factors. Two universities that outperform the predictions for Black and Hispanic students were identified and might be models for further study into how to improve SYCR. If a decision is made to continue this line of analysis, the following are some possible areas of follow-up:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Average faculty salary wasn’t a statistically significant predictor for Black and Hispanic students. Is there a predictor we could replace it with that would be statistically significant for all groups? Can we find out what faculty get the biggest share of pay at each university and see if there are disparities in which ethnicities take those classes?</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly expand the analysis to more ethnicities and see if that changes what predictors are universal.</p></li>
<li><p>How would our conclusions change if we expanded the list of universities?</p></li>
